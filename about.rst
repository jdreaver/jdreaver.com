My name is John David Reaver (most people call me by one of John, David, or
Reaver). My profession is mechanical and software engineering, but I am also a
musician and teacher. I created this blog to share interesting things I find
and also to help me better understand knowledge I gain; the easiest way to
expose gaps in your knowledge is to try and explain something to someone else.
